## Scope

This whitepaper covers why we have a trademark, and why we publish guidance on acceptable use of the Green Software Foundation name and logo.

We have a trademark, to help identify projects as either:

- Projects carried out by the Green Software Foundation.
- Activity that is endorsed by the Green Software Foundation.

In addition, we publish guidance on acceptable use of the logo and name. We do this to maintain the quality of the brand, and we require use of the logo and name to adhere to these guidelines.

This specific guidance is outside the scope of this paper.

## Introduction

It is important to be able to tell when work is either endorsed by, or coming from the GSF. One way to do this is to exercise the use of a trademark to prevent other work being 'passed off' as being endorsed, or coming the GSF when it in fact it does not.

For this to be possible, it is necessary to clearly define acceptable use of the GSF name and branding assets. There also needs to be a process for policing use that does not meet this criteria, and for the GSF to be seen to be actively protecting it.

If this is not defined, it is more difficult to claim a trademark is being protected.  We can point to numerous examples in the open source community, like the [Python Trademark Dispute] of 2013, where this has happened previously.

As a result it is common practice among software foundations to protect the use of, and examples include the [Django Trademark], the [Open Search Trademark], and the [Mozilla Trademark] and the [Wordpress Trademark].

## The GSF and Trademark

The Green Software Foundation and logo are trademarked. Use of either MUST comply with the published guidelines around acceptable use, or express written permission MUST have been provided by the GSF for any use outside these guidelines
